# GreenLedger â€“ Transparent Carbon Action Tracker

## Inspiration
Sustainability initiatives often lack transparency. GreenLedger makes every eco-action visible, verifiable, and rewarding.

## What it does
- Tracks community eco-actions (tree planting, recycling, renewable energy use).
- Verifies contributions with a simulated blockchain log.
- Rewards users with EcoCredits.
- Displays real-time leaderboard for friendly competition.

## How we built it
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS
- Backend: Python simulation for blockchain logic
- Optional AI/photo verification layer for future

## Challenges we ran into
- Balancing simplicity for users with realistic blockchain simulation.
- Making leaderboard updates visually appealing.

## Accomplishments
- Functional MVP in <1 day.
- Gamified eco-action tracking that motivates community engagement.

## What we learned
- Transparency builds trust.
- UX/UI is key for adoption.

## Next Steps
- Integrate real Algorand smart contract.
- Connect leaderboard with actual EcoCredits token.
- Expand to schools and communities.
